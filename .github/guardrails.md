# Project Guardrails

These rules are committed with this repository and should travel with the project across devices.

## Read First (Mandatory)
- Approval-first execution: do not modify files, commit, tag, or push without explicit user approval for that exact next action.
- Pause after each approved action and request approval before the next action.
- Scope lock: do only what was requested; do not add adjacent work.
- Before any implementation action, review these guardrails and confirm they are being applied.
- Initial read-only discovery is allowed before implementation, but no write action may begin until guardrails are reviewed.
- After each action, verify and report exact outcomes (changed files, commit message, push target/hash where applicable).

## Sync Policy
- Keep this file in sync with global rules at `/home/wendallc/.config/Code/User/prompts/global-guardrails.instructions.md`.
- On any project guardrail update, mirror equivalent updates to the global/shared guardrails.
- If there is a conflict, apply the stricter rule.

## Execution Scope
- Follow explicit user requests exactly; do not perform adjacent or substituted actions unless asked.
- Treat every user sentence as an instruction-bearing requirement until explicitly resolved.
- Before first edit, create an internal checklist that maps each sentence/constraint to a concrete action.

## Error Recovery
- If user reports a regression introduced by recent AI edits: roll back the breaking change first.
- Verify rollback success with targeted checks before attempting a new fix.
- Apply one minimal corrective change at a time, then verify before any additional edits.

## Requirements Coverage Gate
- Before final response, confirm each sentence-level requirement is satisfied.
- If any requirement is unsatisfied, continue work instead of finalizing.

## Cleanup and Destructive Actions
- Run dry-run previews first and show exact targets.
- Do not use force-remove patterns.
- Require explicit confirmation before broad/destructive operations.

## Verification Discipline
- After each change, run a targeted status/check command and report outcome.
- Never assume an edit succeeded without verification output.

## Communication Quality
- Use direct, specific language.
- Avoid AI-isms, filler phrasing, and generic "AI-slop" response patterns.

## Content Rule
- No AI written text for user-facing copy unless explicitly requested.

## Node Test Script Safety
- Release/validation commands must use non-watch test modes so commands terminate (for example `vitest run`, not `vitest`).
- Watch mode must be isolated to explicit opt-in scripts (for example `test:watch`) and must not be used in preflight, CI, or release scripts.

## Release Command Discipline
- Use project-defined script commands only for release validation and publishing flows.
- Do not substitute ad-hoc command chains when an official project script exists.
- Path-pin build/release commands to this repository (for example `cd /home/wendallc/Repos/git/github/roughness.technology && ...`) and never rely on inherited cwd.
- Before running package-manager scripts, verify `package.json` exists in the target repo; if not, stop and correct command context first.
- Before release/version commits and tags, require a clean git tree including no untracked files.
- If CI deployment is tag-gated, deployment is incomplete until both commit and tags are pushed.
- Follow README deployment steps exactly in order; do not skip tag creation or alter release commit/tag conventions.
