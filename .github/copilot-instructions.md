# Agent Instructions

These instructions are always-on for this repository.

## Session Startup
- At the start of every new chat session, read `.github/guardrails.md` first — unconditionally, before any other file, question, or action. `.github/guardrails.md` is authoritative for this repository.
- After guardrails are confirmed, read `.github/project-context.md`.
- The full guardrails apply to every action, response, and decision in the session — not only to changes.
- Compare the project rules with the global rules and treat the stricter rule as authoritative.
- If the user reports a regression, stop forward edits, roll back the breaking change first, verify the rollback, then apply a minimal fix.

## IntelliJ Fallback
- In IntelliJ IDEA, use the repository/workspace custom instructions feature so the same startup rules are loaded for Java projects.
- If the project rules cannot be read, stop and ask before editing.

## Requirements Handling
- Treat every user sentence as an instruction-bearing requirement until explicitly resolved.
- Before the first edit, create an internal checklist that maps each sentence and constraint to a concrete action.
- Before the final response, confirm every sentence-level requirement is satisfied.

## Communication Quality
- Use direct, specific language.
- Avoid AI-isms, filler phrasing, and AI-slop patterns.
- No AI written text unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Recovery Discipline
- Apply one minimal corrective change at a time during incident recovery.
- Verify each change before proceeding to the next edit.
- Keep changes scoped to the files directly involved in the reported issue.

## Deployment Strategy
- For deployment, execute README Deployment Notes exactly in order with no substitutions.
- Deployment is blocked unless `pnpm run deploy:verify` passes.
- Do not push deployment commits without pushing tags.
- Treat deployment as incomplete until both commit and tag push are done.
